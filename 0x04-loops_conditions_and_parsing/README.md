#### Overview

The scripts in this project provide practical examples of how loops and conditions can be applied to solve problems and automate tasks using shell scripting. It is designed to teach students the fundamentals of parsing data and making decisions in scripts.

#### Technologies Used

- Bash 4.4
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

#### Files in this Project

- `0-RSA_public_key.pub` - Adds a public RSA key to a server.
- `1-for_best_school` - Demonstrates a simple `for` loop printing custom text.
- `2-while_best_school` - Shows the use of a `while` loop with conditionals.
- `3-until_best_school` - Uses an `until` loop to demonstrate loop termination based on condition failure.
- `4-if_9_say_hi` - Implements an `if` statement inside a loop to execute a conditional action.
- `5-4_bad_luck_8_is_your_chance` - Uses complex conditional logic within a loop to demonstrate control flow.
- `6-superstitious_numbers` - Features loops with multiple conditions to handle various outputs.
- `7-clock` - Simulates a clock using `while` loops.
- `8-for_ls` - Uses a `for` loop to list files and apply conditions.
- `9-to_file_or_not_to_file` - Demonstrates file testing within a loop to check file properties.
- `10-fizzbuzz` - Implements the FizzBuzz game using loops and conditions to handle multiple divisible cases.

#### Usage

Each script can be executed by running a command in the terminal. For example:

#```bash
bash ./1-for_best_school
