### Networking Basics

This project aims to lay the foundation for understanding various fundamental concepts of networking, including the OSI model, types of networks, and key networking protocols. Through these tasks, you'll gain practical knowledge on how computers communicate within different network models.

#### OSI Model

Understanding the OSI Model is crucial in the realm of networking. This section explores the seven layers of the OSI model and their respective roles in data transmission.

#### Types of Networks

This part of the module discusses different types of networks such as LAN, WAN, and WLAN, providing insights into their structures and functionalities within an organizational setting.

#### MAC and IP Addresses

Learn about the importance of MAC and IP addresses in networking. This section covers how these addresses enable devices to communicate over a network by identifying sender and receiver devices uniquely.

#### UDP and TCP

Delve into the two major communication protocols: UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). Understand their differences, advantages, and use cases.

#### TCP and UDP Ports

Ports are endpoints to logical connections and the way a computer can identify specific applications or processes. This section reviews commonly used ports and their applications.

#### Network Tools

Explore various tools that can be used to troubleshoot or configure networks, including commands like `ping` and `netstat`. Learn how to determine if a host is reachable and inspect network traffic.
